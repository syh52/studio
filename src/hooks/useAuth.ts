// This file is a convention if we want to export useAuth separately,
// but it's already defined and exported from src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx.
// For simplicity and to avoid circular dependencies or redundant files,
// we will use the export from AuthContext.tsx directly.
// This file can be deleted or kept empty if a project structure strictly requires it.
// For this project, we will ensure useAuth is imported from '@/contexts/AuthContext'.
// No content needed here as useAuth is co-located with AuthProvider.
